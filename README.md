# Ana Luiza Prata
<sub>*Chemical Engineering student* at Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro</sub>

As a Chemical Engineering student and newcomer to the world of Data Science, I combine critical thinking, analytical vision and a taste for challenges. I live to accumulate new knowledge and apply them to solve problems in order to construct a better future. Make things happen is what I like to do. :bulb:

At this moment I'm searching for my first professional experience as an intern or trainee. In the meanwhile, I keep improving my data science skills.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Matlab and Chemical Engineering.
